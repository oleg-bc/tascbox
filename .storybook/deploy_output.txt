ℹ Speed up Continuous Integration
Your project is linked to GitHub so Chromatic will report results there.
This means you can pass the --exit-once-uploaded flag to skip waiting for build results.

⚠ No 'chromatic' script found in your package.json
Would you like me to add it for you? [y/N]y

✔ Added script 'chromatic' to package.json
You can now run it here or in CI with 'npm run chromatic' or 'yarn chromatic'.

ℹ Your project token was added to the script via the --project-token flag.
If you're running Chromatic via continuous integration, we recommend setting
the CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN environment variable in your CI environment.
You can then remove the --project-token from your package.json script.
